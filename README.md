# Improving Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques using Quantum Computers
Stefano Biondi M.Sc. Thesis in Data Science Repository

## Abstract
On one hand, recent computational developments allowed Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to achieve a huge success. On the other hand, quantum computation can outperform classical computers for specific classes of problems. In this scenario, current research is exploring hybrid quantum-classical systems able to leverage the strength of both systems. The objective of this thesis is to review the two fields and describe some applications of hybrid systems with variational quantum circuits (VQC) applied to classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms. We show the strengths and weaknesses of this new approach. We also give a proof-of-principle implementation of a hybrid algorithm running on quantum hardware from Rigetti.
